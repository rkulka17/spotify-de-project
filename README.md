# spotify-de-project

## This project is extracting data from spotify API and streamlining the playlist data using AWS

This is my first End-to-End pipeline in AWS and I chose Lofi beats from Spotify to build the pipeline on.

STEP 1:

Connect to Spotify Developer https://developer.spotify.com/ and create your account and then your App.
You will recieve a Client Id and Client Secret. DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE!
This will help you connect to Spotify API using python

STEP 2:
Write a function in python
